# Fire_Fighting_Robot
This project is a smart fire-fighting robot powered by an Arduino UNO. It's designed to detect small fires using flame sensors and automatically put them out with a water pump. The robot figures out where the fire is and moves in that direction, using a servo motor to aim and spray water when needed.
